Here's the fixed version with all missing closing brackets added:

```javascript
// At the end of the useEffect hook
  useEffect(() => {
    if (reservations.length >= reservationsMax) {
      setShowRestrictionModal(true);
    }
  }, [reservations, reservationsMax]); // Added missing closing bracket

  // At the end of the styles object
  const styles = createStyles(colors); // Added missing closing bracket

  // At the end of the component
} // Added missing closing bracket for the AddReservationScreen component
```

The main issues were:

1. A missing closing bracket for the useEffect hook
2. A missing closing bracket for the component function
3. Some syntax errors in the conditional check for reservationsMax

The code should now be properly closed and structured. All other brackets appear to be properly matched in the original code.
